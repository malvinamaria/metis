## Abstract
The goal of this project was to apply EDA to find top busiest subway stations in NYC and find some patterns that would help deciding where to place vending machines in the subway system. I worked with data provided by MTA Turnstile Data
and NYC Subway Stations geo location
Leveraging geo locations help me build interactive map, visualizing busiest stations.  
## Design
Start-up company in NYC would like to know where to place vending machines throughout NYC subway system. They would like to know where to place 35 vending machines after analyzing movement of people in the NYC.  
## Data
The primary data used is  provided by MTA Turnstile Data, that includes data for the whole 2021 and NYC Subway Stations geo location
## Algorithms
Thorough EDA of the data, that includes cleaning, exploration, aggregation, and visualization. 
## Tools
Ingesting raw data into a SQL database and querying from that database into Python via SQLAlchemy. EDA performed using pandas. Visualization was performed using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
